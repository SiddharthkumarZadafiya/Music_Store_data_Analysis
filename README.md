# Music_Store_data_Analysis

### Project Overview
#### Objective:
The project aims to analyze a music store's database to extract meaningful insights related to employee information, customer behavior, sales trends, and music preferences. The data analysis will help the store's management make data-driven decisions about sales strategies, customer promotions, and artist collaborations.

#### Data Sources:

The database consists of several tables that may include:

Employees: Contains information about employee details such as job title and hire date.
Invoices: Represents customer purchases, including invoice amounts, dates, and associated customers.
Customers: Holds customer details such as names, emails, locations, and purchase history.
Tracks: Represents individual songs in the store, including attributes like genre, length, and associated artists.
Genres: Contains different categories of music.
Artists: Stores information about music artists.
Invoice_Items: Represents individual items sold on each invoice, including the track and unit price.

#### Key Questions and Solutions:

##### Who is the senior-most employee by job title?

The goal here is to identify the employee with the highest-ranking position in the company. A SQL query involving the Employees table can be used, sorting by job title hierarchy or hire date if applicable.

##### Which country has the most invoices?

This question helps identify the country with the most sales activity. It involves counting the number of invoices per country using a join between the Invoices and Customers tables, grouping by country.

##### What are the top 3 values of total invoice amounts?

By querying the Invoices table, the top 3 invoices with the highest amounts can be retrieved, giving insight into the biggest sales made by the store.

##### Which city has the best customer? (for promotional event planning)

The goal is to identify the city with the highest total sales by summing invoice amounts for each city. This requires joining the Invoices and Customers tables and grouping by city, ordering by total sales.

##### Who is the best customer? (most money spent)

To find the store's top customer, the sum of invoice totals for each customer can be calculated. The customer with the highest total amount spent will be identified.

##### List email, first name, last name, and genre of all rock music listeners.

By joining the Customers, Invoices, Invoice_Items, Tracks, and Genres tables, we can filter out customers who have purchased rock music tracks.

##### Top 10 artists who wrote the most rock music.

This query aims to find the top 10 rock bands/artists with the highest track count. By filtering tracks by genre (rock) and grouping by artist, we can get the desired result.

##### Return track names longer than the average track length.

Using the Tracks table, the average song length is calculated, and then tracks that exceed this length are retrieved.

##### Amount spent by each customer on artists.

This query calculates how much each customer has spent on specific artists by joining Customers, Invoices, Invoice_Items, Tracks, and Artists, grouping by customer and artist.

##### Most popular music genre by country.

To understand genre popularity, this query joins the Invoices, Invoice_Items, Tracks, Genres, and Customers tables, grouping by genre and country and selecting the most popular genre for each.

#### Business Insights:

Sales Strategy: Identifying the top cities and countries by sales volume helps target specific regions for promotions.
Customer Insights: Knowing the best customers by total spend enables the store to offer personalized rewards or loyalty programs.
Artist Collaborations: Understanding which artists are driving the most sales can guide the store in choosing which artists to collaborate with for special releases or promotions.

Event Planning: Determining the city with the most sales can help plan a promotional event or music festival in that location.
Music Preferences: Popular music genres by country allow the store to customize inventory based on regional preferences.

Tools:
SQL: The entire project was conducted using SQL queries, leveraging various clauses like JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, and subqueries for data analysis.

#### Conclusion:
This project provides comprehensive insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and music preferences. It enables the music store's management to make informed decisions regarding marketing strategies, artist collaborations, and event planning.
